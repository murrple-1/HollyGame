Holly's Battle
==============
A Game by Murray Christopherson  
Christmas 2013

Story
-----
Brave Dame Holly of the Sinclair clan was resting peacefully, guarded by her faithful companion and war dog, Sawyer.
They had been travelling for days upon days, and Dame Holly had chosen to set up camp in the shadow of Mount Zilok - a most majestic peak.
Unbeknownst to either of them, the foothills had recently been commandeered by a marauding band of Orks, led by the dishonourable and
wholly unkind General Urgal. He and his lieutenants had watched Dame Holly and Sawyer approach the hills, and had recognized them as the
legendary Ork slayers. Under the cover of night, he and 11 of his best warriors struck, catching Sawyer unawares and dragging him to the
plateau of the mountain. There, to keep him from escaping, the General instructed his 11 best mages to trap Sawyer in stone.
With great difficulty, they succeeded.

Dame Holly woke shortly thereafter, disturbed by the lack of Sawyer's heavy breathing, which she had become accustomed to. She spied the telltale
torchlight from the plateau, and dashed off to save her friend.
